# uta-prelude-script-fixes
This is a patch to help fix the various mistakes and inconsistencies with Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen on steam. This includes translation mistakes and making the terminology more consistent the Mask translations. Some lines were also changed to better flow well in context although this was minimal. Major changes and rewrites are listed in changes.txt but there were a number of smaller fixes that are not mentioned as well.

Some of the major fixes to conistency are:

-Samurai general > Warmaster

-On-Riyahku > Ohn Riyaak

-Decoy > Proxy

-Grand minister > Grand Vizier

-Removed owlo's being referred to as emperors. This doesn't fit with how the Mask games uses these terms and I think it doesn't make sense to call them emperors anyways. Use of imperial is also removed.

-Conversely the term 天子 (tenshi) is rendered as owlo officially but this was translated as Divine Scion in the Mask games. Scion doesn't make sense in the context it's used in here however, so I have opted for Divine Emperor.

-Reversed Kuuya's first and last name back to the original.
